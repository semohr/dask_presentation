## Matrix multiplication

<Note>

Here i used 160 cores in a distributed setup.

For small matrices and computations numpy is faster but for bigger matrices and computations the distributed approaches are faster.

Dask and c++ version quite similar in performance. But the c++ version is a bit faster.

We can now also look at scaling, variing the number of cores.
