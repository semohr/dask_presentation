# Performance

## 3 Tasks

- Matrix multiplication
- Approximation of $\pi$ using the Monte Carlo method
- Read and write data from ORC format



<Note>

To test the performance and scalability of Dask I have looked at three specific tasks:

- Matrix multiplication
- Approximation of pi using the Monte Carlo method 
- Read and write data using apache orc

First matrix multiplication, is one of the most basic tasks that can be parallelized. It is used in nearly all Applications in one way or another.

Here I will compare Dask Array performance to a numpy implementation and Math Kernel Library (MKL) implementation. As I dont have to explain the task too much, let's look at some results.
