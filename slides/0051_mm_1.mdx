## Matrix multiplication

<Note>

Here on one machine with 32 cores I have run matrix multiplication tasks with matrices of different size. 

Numpy and the c++ version performe quite similar to each other. As both implementations use the same cblas_dgemm function call the similar performance was expected. 

Dask look a bit worse of but that was expected, as it uses numpy but has some overhead for the task scheduling and communication thus it is a bit slower.

All as expected but good to see that in the experiment.

Next we can look at more cores and more machines.
