## Task graph

Let's take this small example:

```python
def inc(i):
    return i + 1

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

x = 1
y = inc(x)
z = add(y, 10)

```

</Column>

<Column>

<div style={{visibility: "hidden"}}>
## Task graph
</div>

Internally dask encodes a graph as dict:

```python
d = {'x': 1,
     'y': (inc, 'x'),
     'z': (add, 'y', 10)}

# Tasks are tuples
task = (function, *args,)

# kwargs can also be used
from dask.utils import apply
task = (apply, func, args, kwargs)

# Execution
get(d, 'z')
```


</Column>


<Note>

Internally dask would represent these computation as dicts, where the keys are the name of the variable and the values are the tasks that have to be performed.

Tasks are tuples containing the function and the arguments that have to be passed to the task entry point i.e. a function.

This is by design a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and will look like this:
