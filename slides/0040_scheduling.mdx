Simplified, Dask scheduling consists of three parts, the client, the scheduler, and the workers.

As a developer or scientist you'll mainly communicate with the Dask **Client**. It send instructions to the Scheduler and collects results from the Workers. On this client level, the DAG is created.

The **Scheduler** is the central coordinator between the workers and the client. It tracks metrics, and allows the workers to coordinate. The scheduler also decides 
which computations to run, when and on which worker.
The scheduler is a single point of failure but generally a very stable dask component.

If a worker crashes or encounters an error, the scheduler will reassign the work to another worker.

There are multiple ways to define Dask Workers.
