## Task graph

Let's take this small example:

```python
def inc(i):
    return i + 1

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

x = 1
y = inc(x)
z = add(y, 10)

```

</Column>

</Column>



<Note>

Here we have the same operations as defined before we want to compute `z` and list all
dependencies below which can than be executed starting from the bottom.

Using this framework gives us now the possibility to create abitrarily complex graphs on our own and run
them using dask.
