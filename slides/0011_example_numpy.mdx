<Note>


- First you load your data using pandas
- Then you write your analysis function
  - Here we do performe very complex calculations on the
    data using numpy


All this works great for you and your (small) data. Therefore, you share your work with some collaborators.
These notice that your analysis might be usefull for their data and they want **you** to run
your analysis on their data.

You are happy to help and try to run the analysis on their data.
