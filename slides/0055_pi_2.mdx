## Approximation of $\pi$

<Note>

Here we see that scalability probablity has a threshold or at least seems to be converging. Thus,throwing more cores at the problem does not necessarily improve the performance. At least that holds for these
two implementations.

Lastly I looked at data read and write performance. Here I used the apache orc format, which is similar to parquet, but easier to work with.

Dask dataframe already has a read_orc function, which I used and compared to the core c++ orc library.
