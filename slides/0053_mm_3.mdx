## Matrix multiplication

<Note>

Numpy is not scaling above one machine. But it looks like the c++ implementation and dask scale quite similar, even if the relative performance is different.


My next task I wanted to look into approximating pi using Monte Carlo methods. Here the main task is to generate random numbers.
