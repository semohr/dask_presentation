## Example: Dask array

<div style={{marginBottom:"2rem", height:"100%", display:"flex"}}>

Dask array coordinates many Numpy arrays, arranged into chunks within a grid.

We can perform most numpy operation on this array as we would on a normal numpy array.

Depending on the operation data is exchanged between the chunks. This is done automatically and you dont have to think about it.

Dask normally defines the chunk size on its own depending on your environment. But you can also define it yourself.


Dask also allows to precompute memory usage of chunks and the total memory usage of the array without actually computing the array.


Second there is the task graph.
