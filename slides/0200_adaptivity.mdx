## Scheduling

Adaptivity

Dask jobqueue can also adapt the number of workers dynamically based on current load (if specified).

```python
cluster.adapt(minimum=1, maximum=10)
cluster.adapt(maximum_memory="10 TB") 
```
</Column>
<Note>

An additional very useful feature is the adaptivity of the dask scheduler. This allows to dynamically change the number of workers based on the current load. 
Your cluster administrator will be thankful if you use this feature as we dont want to allocate resources which are barely used.
