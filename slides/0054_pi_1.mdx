## Approximation of $\pi$

<Note>

All methods scale quite similarly, but interesting dask beeing more performant than numpy
even on a single machine. And again using mpi and mkl is the most performant method, but might be not the most convinient to implement and use.

Before the questions comes, yes I checked that the same random number generator is used in all cases.

Again we can also look at the scalability of the different methods.
