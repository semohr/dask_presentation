<Note>

Dask mainly consitst of three components:

First are the collections.
Second is the task graph.
Third is the scheduling of said task graphs.

First up, collections. Here dask supplies a number of high and low level 
interfaces to injest, generate and manipulate data.

Easy to use high level interfaces, such as array and dataframe, are built on top of the low level graph specification. This allows for easy customization and extension. Very convinient.

Dask also allows for low level task scheduling with custom workloads and data structures. This is useful for people who have complex problems or non-Python workloads, and want to execute efficiently on a cluster.
