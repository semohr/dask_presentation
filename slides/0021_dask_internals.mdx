<Note>

First up, collections. Here dask supplies a number of high and low level 
interfaces to injest, generate and manipulate data.


We have already seen two most used high level interface, the dataframe and array in
the earlier example.
These dask modules are designed to be interchangeable their normal counterpart api.


To make this work internally, dask splits pandas dataframes or numpy arrays into many smaller chunks
and then distributed across the workers. 

For example dask coordinate many Numpy arrays, arranged into chunks within a grid.
