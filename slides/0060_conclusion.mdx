## Conclusion

- Low entry point into the hpc computing
- Easy scaling and usability as the main focus
- Offers a lot of flexibility and allows to parallelize complex workflows
- Might not be the best choice for pure performance

</Column>



<Note>

To finiish this let's come to the conclusion.


Dask offers a low boundry entry into the hpc world without alot of prior needed knowledge.

It allows to scale big workloads easily and keeps usability as a main concern. 

It is quite easy to use and offers a lot of flexibility with complex tasks.

On the other hand if pure performance is the main concern, dask might not be the best choice. For example, for pure number crunching tasks more specialized frameworks might be better suited. But for loading and processig data, dask looks like a great choice.

I hope you learned something new and enjoyed.
