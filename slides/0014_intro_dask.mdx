  ### Scale PyData libraries

  Dask makes it easy to scale the Python libraries that you know and love like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

<div>
  ### Scale any Python code

  Parallelize any Python code with Dask Futures, letting you scale any function and for loop, and giving you control and power in any situation.

  ### Deploy anywhere

  Start on a laptop, but scale to a cluster, no matter what infrastructure you use. Dask [...] make it easy to use as much or as little compute as you need.

<Note>

This is where the Dask project sees itself. To roughtly quote them:

Dask allow you to easily scale pydata libraries to make use of all of you compute with little effort. That
means that overall there are quite a lot of libraries which support dask or are build on top of it.

Dask also allows you to scale any python code using their Futures API. Meaning that even if you use plain vanilla python 
you can still scale any function or for loop and parallize it as you are used to with the standard api.

Finally dask allows you to deploy your code anywhere, from a laptop to a cluster with little to no configuration overhead. 
That is dask allows you to schedule on your local machine using parallilsm or on a distributed system.

Let's shortly have look at our example from earlier, now using dask.
